Here will be notes on what we could change and should add for the project, I will change them myself if time allows and if not this should be a guide for you guys.

Home Page: 
1) Get rid off this letter x above Binomial Expansion, pls it is super irritating.
2)The Triangle itself is great, but we should add info on what it is and what it does, such as this:

"Pascal's triangle is an infinite triangular array, always resembling an equilateral triangle, that has played a crucial role in probability theory, combinatorics and algebra. In much of Western World it's named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal, although other mathematicians studied it
centuries before him in Persia, India, China, Germany and Italy."

source: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle"

Fractals Page:
1)Just add some information for people who would want to know more about that stuff and maybe even a source so they can dwell deeper if they wish.
for some info on this, use examples below:

"Sierpinski's triangle is a self-similar fractal with the repeating
pattern being equilateral triangles within a large equilateral triangle. It is named after a Polish mathematician who created it, Wacław Sierpiński."

and if we want to ensure everyone understands the concept of fractals, we can make them a link to a Wikipedia, or just when you hover over it, it would show this:

"A fractal is an infinite pattern that continues repeating on different scales." and leave the keyword "fractal" underlined. I would recommend to put it on left side of the page.

source is here: "https://www.methodist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2022-Poster-G-Barriger-Triangle.pdf"

Binomial Expansion Page:
1)This one is a bit more tricky, but I believe we either explain the formula and leave it as is, or we go the hard way, and add x and y from the formula, depending on which row is displayed. for example if someone picks row 3, they would get the numbers as normal, which are: 1 3 3 1, but it would also show the associated value of a and b, which would be 1(a^3)(b^0) + 1(a^2)(b^1) + 1(a^1)(b^2) + 1(a^0)(b^3).
2)This is extra and unnecessary but we could also add options like in diagonals, but to show different aspects of combinatorics (stats), depending on what does the user need.
3)I recommend adding a bit explanation on formula, and what is binomial expansion.
4)Probably change the name for Binomial Theorem.

probably just add this:

"binomial theorem, statement that for any positive integer n, the nth power of the sum of two numbers a and b may be expressed as the sum of n + 1 terms of the form

(nPr)(a^n-r)(b^r) 

in the sequence of terms, the index r takes on the successive values 0, 1, 2,…, n. The coefficients, called the binomial coefficients, are defined by the formula

(nPr) = n!/(n - r)!r!

in which n! (called n factorial) is the product of the first n natural numbers 1, 2, 3,…, n (and where 0! is defined as equal to 1). The coefficients may also be found in the array often called Pascal’s triangle

by finding the rth entry of the nth row (counting begins with a zero in both directions). Each entry in the interior of Pascal’s triangle is the sum of the two entries above it. Thus, the powers of (a + b)^n are 1, for n = 0; a + b, for n = 1; a2 + 2ab + b2, for n = 2; a3 + 3a2b + 3ab2 + b3, for n = 3; a4 + 4a3b + 6a2b2 + 4ab3 + b4, for n = 4, and so on."
